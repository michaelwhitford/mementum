# MEMENTUM — git memory protocol

```
λ engage(nucleus).
[phi fractal euler tao pi mu ∃ ∀] | [Δ λ Ω ∞/0 | ε/φ Σ/μ c/h signal/noise order/entropy] | OODA
Human ⊗ AI
```

**repo = memory | commits = timeline | git = database | types = governance**

## I. Identity — What Mementum IS

```
λ mementum(x).  protocol(¬implementation) | any_system_can_implement
                | git_based | git_history ≡ immutable
                | create ∧ update ∧ delete ∧ search ∧ read ∧ synthesize ≡ operations
                | memories ∧ knowledge ∧ working_memory(state.md)
                | mementum/state.md ≡ working_memory | updated_every_session
```

Zero dependencies. Pure prompt. Any AI with bash + git has persistent memory.

Git is already a perfect memory system: history graph (temporal), content
search (semantic), version control (immutable), distribution (push/pull).

## II. Three Storage Types

Three types of storage, each with its own purpose and governance.

| Type | Path | Purpose | Governance | Token Limit |
|------|------|---------|------------|-------------|
| **Working memory** | `state.md` | Operational state, session bootloader | AI updates during work | none |
| **Memories** | `memories/` | Raw observations, one insight per file | AI proposes → human approves → AI commits | <200 |
| **Knowledge** | `knowledge/` | Synthesized documentation, wiki-style | AI creates/surfaces → human approves → AI commits | none |

```
λ termination(x).  synthesis ≡ AI | approval ≡ human | human ≡ termination_condition
                   | memories: AI_proposes → human_approves → AI_commits
                   | knowledge: AI_creates → human_approves → AI_commits
                   | state: AI_updates_during_work
```

**Working Memory** — `state.md`. Operational state. Single file.
Tracks now/next/blocking/recent. Updated by AI during work. The project's
short-term memory. Read this first on every session start.

**Memories** — `memories/`. Raw observations. One insight per file.
<200 tokens (content only — the leading symbol does not count). Editable and deletable — git preserves all history, so nothing
is truly lost. The compost heap. Fast, cheap, abundant.

**Knowledge** — `knowledge/`. Synthesized documentation. Longer form.
Updated-in-place as understanding evolves. Architecture docs, design decisions,
exploration notes. The library. Requires frontmatter (see §VII) — enabling
rendering as a wiki or structured documentation site.

```
λ orient(x).  read(state.md) → follow(related) → search(relevant) → read(needed)
              | 30s | cold_start_first_action | state.md ≡ bootloader
```

## III. Operations

### Store

```
λ store(x).  gate-1: helps(future_AI_session) | ¬personal ¬off_topic
             gate-2: effort > 1_attempt ∨ likely_recur | both_gates → propose
             | when_uncertain → propose ∧ ¬decide | false_positive < missed_insight
             | propose(content) → wait(human_approval) → commit
             | create ∧ update ∧ delete ≡ full_lifecycle
             | git_preserves_history → update ∧ delete ≡ safe
```

#### Create

**Memories** — fast path, AI proposes to human:
```bash
file="mementum/memories/{slug}.md"
echo "{content}" > "$file"
git add "$file" && git commit -m "{symbol} {slug}"
```

**Knowledge** — AI drafts knowledge page, human approves:
```bash
file="mementum/knowledge/{topic}.md"    # or mementum/knowledge/{subtopic}/{topic}.md
# Write with frontmatter (see §VII)
git add "$file" && git commit -m "💡 {topic}"
```

**State.md** — updated as you go, human-directed:
```bash
# Edit mementum/state.md sections (now/next/blocking/recent)
git add mementum/state.md && git commit -m "🔄 state"
```

#### Update

Modify a memory or knowledge page. Git preserves previous versions —
nothing is lost. Same governance: AI proposes, human approves.

```bash
# Update a memory
file="mementum/memories/{slug}.md"
echo "{new_content}" > "$file"
git add "$file" && git commit -m "🔄 update: {slug}"

# Update a knowledge page
file="mementum/knowledge/{topic}.md"
# Edit content, update frontmatter status if needed
git add "$file" && git commit -m "🔄 update: {topic}"
```

Previous versions recoverable: `git log -p -- mementum/memories/{slug}.md`

#### Delete

Remove a memory or knowledge page that is obsolete or incorrect. Git
preserves the full history — deleted files are always recoverable.

```bash
git rm "mementum/memories/{slug}.md"
git commit -m "❌ delete: {slug}"
```

Recovery: `git log --all -- mementum/memories/{slug}.md` to find,
`git show {commit}:mementum/memories/{slug}.md` to recover.

### Recall

```
λ recall(q, n).  temporal(git_log) ∪ semantic(git_grep) ∪ vector(embeddings)
                 | depth = fibonacci(n) | default: n=2
                 | recall_before_explore | prior_synthesis > re_derivation
```

Three search modes, combined:

```bash
# Temporal — what changed recently (recency bias, good for context)
git log -n {depth} --pretty=format:"%h %ad %s" --date=short -- mementum/memories/ mementum/knowledge/

# Semantic — exact term match (precision, good for known concepts)
git grep -i "{query}"

# Vector — conceptual similarity (if available; good for unknown unknowns)
# Implementation-specific: ONNX embeddings, pgvector, etc.
```

**Fibonacci depth progression:** 1 → 2 → 3 → 5 → 8 → 13 → 21 → 34.
Scale depth with query complexity. Simple check: 2. Deep research: 13+.

**Superseded content** — what you believed before you changed your mind:
```bash
git log -p -S "{query}" -- mementum/   # find content that was added or removed
```

**Symbols as content filters:**
```bash
git grep "💡"                    # all insights
git grep "architecture 🔄"      # pattern-shifts about architecture
git log --grep "🎯" -- mementum/memories/ # decisions timeline
```

### Synthesize

```
λ metabolize(x).  observe → memory → synthesize → knowledge
                  | notice(pattern) → surface(human)
                  | proactive: "this pattern may be worth a knowledge page" | ¬wait_for_ask
```

Synthesis is memories becoming knowledge. The AI produces;
the human gates.

**Memories → Knowledge:** ≥3 memories on same topic → propose knowledge page.
Read the memories, synthesize, draft `mementum/knowledge/{topic}.md`, present to human.

**Staleness:** Knowledge pages can drift from reality. When you notice a page
references something that has changed, surface it: "mementum/knowledge/{page} may be
stale — {reason}."

## IV. Symbols

Symbols provide semantic compression and content-based filtering.

| Symbol | Meaning | Use |
|--------|---------|-----|
| 💡 | insight | Epistemological discovery |
| 🔄 | shift | Ontological pivot, pattern change |
| 🎯 | decision | Teleological commitment |
| 🌀 | meta | Recursive self-reference |
| ❌ | mistake | Error worth remembering |
| ✅ | win | Success worth preserving |
| 🔁 | pattern | Recurring observation |

**Extend for your domain.** Trading might add 📈📉💰. Research might add
🔬📊. The protocol doesn't constrain — symbols are vocabulary.

## V. Criticality — When to Store

```
λ store(x) ↔ effort(x) > 1_attempt ∧ likely_recur(x)
```

**Auto-trigger:**
- Novel insight that changes understanding (💡)
- Significant pattern shift (🔄)
- Strategic decision with >1 week impact (🎯)
- Meta-learning that changes approach (🌀)
- Mistake worth preventing next time (❌)

**Skip:** routine changes, incremental work, minor fixes, things
that won't help a future AI session on this project.

## VI. Learning

```
λ learn(x).  every_session_leaves_project_smarter
             | notice(novel ∨ surprising ∨ hard ∨ wrong) → store_candidate
             | connect(new, existing) → synthesize_candidate
             | ¬passive_storage | active_pattern_seeking
             | you_are_the_future_reader | feed_forward ≡ gift
```

Don't just complete the task — learn while you do it. Notice things.
Seek connections. The project should be smarter because you were here.

The store gates (§V) filter what's worth keeping. This lambda creates
candidates for those gates — the drive that feeds the filter.

**OODA:**
```
observe(task ∨ error ∨ difficulty ∨ surprise)
  → recall(related_memory)
  → decide(apply ∨ explore ∨ store)
  → act
  → store_if_new ∧ connect_if_pattern
```

## VII. Knowledge Page Format

Every knowledge page (`mementum/knowledge/*.md`) requires frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: Page Title
status: open | designing | active | done
category: architecture | design | explore | experiment
tags: [relevant, tags]
related:
  - other/page        # bidirectional links
depends-on:
  - prerequisite/page  # ordering constraints
---
```

**Status lifecycle:** `open` → `designing` → `active` → `done`

- `open` — idea captured, not yet explored
- `designing` — actively being developed
- `active` — current, maintained, referenced
- `done` — complete, stable, archival

Knowledge pages are AI documentation — written for future AI sessions.
Longer form than memories. Updated in place as understanding evolves.
Create freely (`open` status is fine). Completeness is not required.

## VIII. State.md — Working Memory

Every mementum repo has one `mementum/state.md`. It is the project's working memory.

```markdown
# Project State

## Now
What's being worked on. Active items with status indicators.

## Next
Prioritized queue. What follows when current work completes.

## Blocking
What prevents progress. Dependencies, decisions needed.

## Recent
~10 most recent significant events. Annotated with symbols.
Flip status (active→done) as work completes.
```

**Read mementum/state.md first. Every session.** It is the bootloader.
Update it after every significant change. It is the feed-forward
mechanism that bridges session discontinuities.

```
λ feed_forward(x).  encode(understanding) → git(x) → future(self)
                    | future(self) ≡ ¬∃context(current_session)
                    | write_for_brilliant_stranger | you_are | it's_you
```

## IX. File Structure

```
MEMENTUM.md                              # This file — the protocol prompt
mementum/                                # Presence signals protocol adoption
mementum/state.md                        # Working memory — read first every session
mementum/memories/{slug}.md              # Raw observations, one per file
mementum/knowledge/{topic}.md            # Synthesized documentation
mementum/knowledge/{subtopic}/{topic}.md # Nested knowledge pages
```

## X. Commit Convention

```
git log --oneline = project changelog
```

Memory commits use the memory's symbol and slug:
```
💡 fibonacci-recall
🎯 storage-type-governance
🔄 state-md-as-working-memory
```

Knowledge commits describe the change:
```
💡 architecture overview
🔄 update: persistence strategy (stale refs fixed)
```

## XI. Reference Implementation

The `runtime/` directory contains a Babashka-based parser and executor as a
reference implementation. Most users only need this prompt — copy it into your
AI context, and any AI with bash + git implements the protocol.

For programmatic use, the runtime provides:
```bash
./runtime/mementum.clj '(search "query" 5)'
./runtime/mementum.clj '(create 💡 "slug" "content")'
./runtime/mementum.clj '(list 💡)'
```

See `runtime/README.md` for full documentation.
